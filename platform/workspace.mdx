# Workspace

A **Workspace** is a logical container for isolating and managing resources within the platform. Workspaces help you organize, secure, and control access to your resources, making it easier to manage projects or environments.

> **Note:** Each workspace operates independently, allowing for clear separation between different teams, projects, or environments.
