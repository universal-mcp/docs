## This guide will walk you through the basic steps to set up an application with an action, using both the AgentR integration for cloud-based OAuth and credential management, and a local setup using API Key integration.

## **Using AgentR Cloud**

1. Visit [agentr.dev](http://agentr.dev) and signup
2. [**<u>https://agentr.dev/quickstart</u>**](https://agentr.dev/quickstart)
3. Enable required applications at [**<u>https://agentr.dev/apps</u>**](https://agentr.dev/apps)

## **Local Setup**

This option is suitable if you are working with an API that uses simple API key authentication and you want to manage it locally.

**Prerequisites:**

- You have an API key for the service you want to integrate with.

**Steps:**

1. **Choose a Credential Store:**
   - **Environment Variable:** Store your API key in an environment variable (e.g., `MY_SERVICE_API_KEY`). This is common and secure.
   - **Keyring:** Use the system's secure credential storage.
   - **Memory:** For testing/temporary use only (not persistent).
2. **Choose an Application class:** Use a pre built application or build your own application class. Refer to /applications to learn how to build your own.
3. **Configure Integration and Initialize Application (Python):** In your Python script, set up the API key integration and initialize your application.

   ```python
   from universal_mcp.applications import APIApplication # Or your specific App class
   from universal_mcp.integrations import ApiKeyIntegration
   from universal_mcp.stores import EnvironmentStore, MemoryStore
   from universal_mcp.server import SingleAppMCPServer
   
   
   # Option 2b: Using MemoryStore (for quick testing)
   store_mem = MemoryStore()
   # Manually add the key to the memory store for this example
   # The 'name_in_store' is the key used within the store
   api_key_name_in_store = "MY_APP_API_KEY"
   store_mem.set(api_key_name_in_store, "dummy_api_key_12345") # Replace with your actual key
   
   integration_mem = ApiKeyIntegration(
       name_in_store=api_key_name_in_store, # Key to lookup in the store
       store=store_mem,
   )
   
   app_local_mem = MyApp(name="my-app", integration=integration_mem)
   print(f"Local App '{app_local_mem.name}' initialized. Actions: {app_local_mem.list_tools()}")
   
   mcp = SingleAppMCPServer(app_local_mem)
   
   ```
4. **Ceate your MCP Server:**
5. **Install MCP server**: Install mcp server on your favourite client using `mcp install`
