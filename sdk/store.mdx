Stores provide a secure and consistent way to manage credentials and sensitive data across different storage backends. Use stores to set, retrieve, and delete credentials in a unified manner, regardless of the underlying storage mechanism.

## Features

- Abstract base class defining a consistent interface for credential stores
- Multiple storage backend implementations:
  - In-memory store (temporary storage)
  - Environment variable store
  - System keyring store (secure credential storage)
- Exception handling for common error cases
- Type hints and comprehensive documentation

## When to Use Each Store

Choose the store type that best fits your environment and security needs:

- **MemoryStore**: Use for testing or temporary storage. Data is lost when the program exits.
- **EnvironmentStore**: Ideal for CI/CD pipelines or containerized environments where environment variables are managed externally.
- **KeyringStore**: Recommended for production and local development when you need secure, persistent storage using the system keyring.

## Available Store Types

### MemoryStore
A simple in-memory store that persists data only for the duration of program execution. Useful for testing or temporary storage.

```python
from universal_mcp.stores import MemoryStore

store = MemoryStore()
store.set("api_key", "secret123")
value = store.get("api_key")  # Returns "secret123"
```

### EnvironmentStore
Uses environment variables to store and retrieve credentials. Useful for containerized environments or CI/CD pipelines.

```python
from universal_mcp.stores import EnvironmentStore

store = EnvironmentStore()
store.set("API_KEY", "secret123")
value = store.get("API_KEY")  # Returns "secret123"
```

### KeyringStore
Leverages the system's secure credential storage facility. Provides the most secure option for storing sensitive data.

```python
from universal_mcp.stores import KeyringStore

store = KeyringStore(app_name="my_app")
store.set("api_key", "secret123")
value = store.get("api_key")  # Returns "secret123"
```

## Getting Started

Here's how to use a store to set and retrieve a credential:

```python
from universal_mcp.stores import MemoryStore

store = MemoryStore()
store.set("api_key", "secret123")
value = store.get("api_key")  # Returns "secret123"
```

Switch to `EnvironmentStore` or `KeyringStore` by importing and instantiating the relevant class.

## Best Practices

1. Use **KeyringStore** for production environments where security is a priority.
2. Use **EnvironmentStore** for containerized or cloud environments.
3. Use **MemoryStore** for testing or temporary storage only.
4. Always handle `StoreError` and `KeyNotFoundError` exceptions appropriately.

## Error Handling

The store module provides specific exceptions:

- `StoreError`: Base exception for all store-related errors.
- `KeyNotFoundError`: Raised when a requested key is not found.

Handle these exceptions to ensure robust credential management:

```python
from universal_mcp.stores import KeyNotFoundError

try:
    value = store.get("missing_key")
except KeyNotFoundError:
    print("Credential not found.")
```

## Dependencies

- `keyring`: Required for the KeyringStore implementation
- `loguru`: Used for logging operations in the KeyringStore

## Contributing

To add a new store implementation, inherit from `BaseStore` and implement all required abstract methods:

- `get(key: str) -> Any`
- `set(key: str, value: str) -> None`
- `delete(key: str) -> None`
