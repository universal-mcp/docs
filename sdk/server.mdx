Universal MCP provides multiple server implementations to host and expose MCP applications and their tools. Each server type is designed for different use cases, from local development to production deployment.

## Supported Server Types

### Local Server
The `LocalServer` class is ideal for local development and self-hosting. It:
- Loads applications from local configuration
- Manages a local store for data persistence
- Supports integration with external services
- Exposes application tools through the MCP protocol

### AgentR Server
The `AgentRServer` class connects to the AgentR platform for dynamic app loading and credential management. It:
- Connects to the AgentR API
- Dynamically fetches and loads available applications
- Manages AgentR-specific integrations
- Requires an API key for authentication

### Single MCP Server
The `SingleMCPServer` class is a minimal server for testing and single-app hosting. It:
- Hosts a single application instance
- Is ideal for development and testing
- Does not manage integrations or stores internally
- Exposes only the tools from the provided application

## Core Features

All server implementations provide:
- Tool management and registration
- Application loading and configuration
- Error handling and logging
- MCP protocol compliance
- Integration support

## Usage

You can initialize each server implementation with a `ServerConfig` object that specifies:
- Server name and description
- Port configuration
- Application configurations
- Store configuration (where applicable)

**Example:**
```python
from universal_mcp.servers import LocalServer
from universal_mcp.config import ServerConfig

config = ServerConfig(
    name="My Local Server",
    description="Development server for testing applications",
    port=8000,
    # ... additional configuration
)

server = LocalServer(config)
```

## Tool Management

Servers provide methods for:
- Adding individual tools
- Listing available tools
- Calling tools with proper error handling
- Formatting tool results

## Error Handling

All servers implement comprehensive error handling for:
- Tool execution failures
- Application loading errors
- Integration setup issues
- API communication problems
