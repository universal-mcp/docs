Universal MCP provides multiple server implementations:

Local Server: Loads applications from local config, suitable for development or self hosting.

AgentR Server: Connects to the AgentR platform for dynamic app loading and credential management.

Single MCP Server: Minimal, hosts a single app instance for testing.

Servers manage application/tool registration, integration setup, and protocol compliance.
