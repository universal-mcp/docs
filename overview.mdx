The **Universal MCP system** is a framework designed to enable AI models to interact with external systems and APIs. It achieves this through a core set of components:

- **Applications**
- **Actions**
- **Integration**
- **Triggers**
---
## Applications

Applications form the foundation for connecting to external services. They manage aspects like:

- Authentication
- API communication
- Defining available operations
- Handling responses and errors

The system provides base classes to simplify the creation of new applications:

- `BaseApplication` (abstract base class)
- `APIApplication` (for HTTP APIs)
- `GraphQLApplication` (for GraphQL APIs)

> **Tip:** Creating a new application involves setting up a specific package structure and implementing a class that inherits from one of these base classes.

## Actions

Actions define the specific operations that an application can perform. These allow AI models to:

- Execute external functions
- Call APIs
- Process data
- Interact with real-world systems

**Key features of Actions:**

- Dynamic function calling
- Structured input/output
- Integration with various authentication methods
- Error handling
- Tool management

> **How to create custom actions:**
> - Define methods within an application class
> - Include type hints and docstrings
> - Implement error handling
> - Register them in the `list_tools()` method

---

## Integration

Integration is the mechanism that allows Applications and Actions to work together. It handles:

- Authentication
- Credential management
- API communication
- Error handling

The system supports several integration types, including:

- API Key
- OAuth
- Basic Auth

---

## Triggers

Triggers act as a notification system, enabling AI agents to respond dynamically to external events from integrated applications (like GitHub or Gmail).

> When specific events occur in these applications, triggers notify the agents, allowing for real-time, event-driven workflows.
