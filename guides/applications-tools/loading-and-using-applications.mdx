title: Loading and Using Applications
---

Universal MCP makes it straightforward to incorporate and use applications within your server, enabling your AI agents to access their tools.

## Dynamic Application Loading with `app_from_slug`

One of the powerful features of Universal MCP is its ability to dynamically load application packages. If an application follows the standard naming convention (`universal-mcp-<app-name>`), it can often be loaded using the `app_from_slug` function.

The `app_from_slug` function (found in [`applications.__init__.py`](https://github.com/universal-mcp/universal-mcp/blob/master/src/universal_mcp/applications/__init__.py)) handles several tasks:
1.  **Derives Names:** It determines the expected package name (e.g., `universal_mcp_my_app`), module path (e.g., `universal_mcp_my_app.app`), and class name (e.g., `MyAppApp`) from the provided slug (e.g., `"my-app"`).
2.  **Installs/Upgrades Package:** It attempts to install or upgrade the application package from the universal-mcp GitHub repository using `uv`. The packages are installed into a dedicated directory (usually `~/.universal-mcp/packages/`).
3.  **Imports Module:** It imports the application module.
4.  **Retrieves Class:** It gets the application class from the imported module.

**Usage Example:**

Let's say you want to use the `reddit` application.

```python
from universal_mcp.applications import app_from_slug
from universal_mcp.integrations import AgentRIntegration # Or another appropriate integration

# Dynamically load the Reddit application class
try:
    RedditAppClass = app_from_slug("reddit")
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Failed to load application: {e}")
    # Handle error, perhaps guide user to install or check slug
    exit()
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Class not found in application: {e}")
    exit()

# Configure an integration (if needed by the application)
# For applications using AgentR for credential management:
reddit_integration = AgentRIntegration(name="reddit") # 'name' should match the integration configured on AgentR

# For other integrations, you might use ApiKeyIntegration, etc.
# e.g., an_api_key_integration = ApiKeyIntegration(name="MY_REDDIT_API_KEY_CONFIG", store=my_store)

# Instantiate the application
reddit_app_instance = RedditAppClass(integration=reddit_integration)

# Now you can register its tools with a ToolManager
# tool_manager.register_tools_from_app(reddit_app_instance)
```

This approach is commonly used in the example agent scripts (like [`examples/reddit_summary.py`](https://github.com/universal-mcp/examples/blob/master/agents/reddit_summary.py) or [`examples/like_tweet.py`](https://github.com/universal-mcp/examples/blob/master/agents/like_tweet.py)) to quickly set up applications.

## Manual Application Instantiation

If your application is part of your local project or you prefer more direct control, you can import and instantiate it directly:

```python
# Assuming 'my_custom_app_module.py' contains 'MyCustomApp' class
from my_custom_app_module import MyCustomApp
from universal_mcp.integrations import ApiKeyIntegration
from universal_mcp.stores import EnvironmentStore

# Configure an integration
my_api_key_store = EnvironmentStore()
my_custom_app_integration = ApiKeyIntegration(name="MY_SERVICE_API_KEY", store=my_api_key_store)

# Instantiate
my_app = MyCustomApp(integration=my_custom_app_integration)

# Register tools
# tool_manager.register_tools_from_app(my_app)
```

## Configuring Applications in `ServerConfig`

When running a `LocalServer`, you typically define which applications to load in your server configuration file (e.g., `local_config.json`):

```json
{
  // ... other server settings ...
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "reddit" // This slug will be used by app_from_slug internally
      // Optional: add integration config if not using a global or AgentR managed one
      // "integration": {
      //   "name": "REDDIT_API_KEY_CONFIG",
      //   "type": "api_key",
      //   "store": {"type": "environment"}
      // }
    },
    {
      "name": "my-local-app-slug" // For another app
    }
  ]
}
```
The `LocalServer` will then iterate through this `apps` list, use `app_from_slug` to load each application class, instantiate it (potentially with the specified integration), and then register its tools.

Once an application is instantiated, its primary use is to provide tools to a `ToolManager`, which then makes them available to AI agents.
