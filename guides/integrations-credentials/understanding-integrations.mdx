title: Understanding Integrations in Universal MCP
---

In Universal MCP, an **Integration** is a crucial component that defines how an `Application` authenticates and authorizes itself with an external service provider. It handles the complexities of managing credentials and applying them correctly when an Application makes calls to an API.

## The Role of an Integration

The primary responsibilities of an Integration object are:

1.  **Authorization:** Implementing the specific steps required to authorize the application with the external service. This might involve redirecting a user for an OAuth flow or prompting for an API key.
2.  **Credential Storage and Retrieval:** Securely obtaining and providing credentials (like API keys, access tokens, refresh tokens) when an Application needs them to make an authenticated request. This is often done in conjunction with a [Store](/guides/integrations-credentials/secure-credential-storage).
3.  **Credential Refresh (for OAuth):** Handling the process of refreshing access tokens when they expire, ensuring continuous access for the Application.

By abstracting these concerns into an `Integration` object, `Applications` can focus on the logic of interacting with the service's API endpoints, rather than the boilerplate of authentication.

## The `Integration` Base Class

All specific integration types in Universal MCP inherit from the `Integration` abstract base class (defined in [`integrations/integration.py`](https://github.com/universal-mcp/universal-mcp/blob/master/src/universal_mcp/integrations/integration.py)). This class defines a common interface with key methods:

*   `__init__(self, name: str, store: BaseStore | None = None)`: Initializes the integration with a name (often used as a key for storing/retrieving credentials) and an optional `Store` instance.
*   `authorize() -> str | dict[str, Any]`: Abstract method to initiate the authorization process. Returns information needed to complete authorization, like a URL or instructions.
*   `get_credentials() -> dict[str, Any]`: Abstract method to retrieve the necessary credentials for the integration.
*   `set_credentials(self, credentials: dict[str, Any]) -> None`: Abstract method to store new credentials.

## Supported Integration Types

Universal MCP provides several built-in integration types:

*   **`ApiKeyIntegration`**: For services that use simple API key-based authentication.
*   **`OAuthIntegration`**: For services that use OAuth 2.0 flows.
*   **`AgentRIntegration`**: A specialized integration for services managed through the AgentR platform. It uses an AgentR API key to securely fetch service-specific credentials managed by AgentR.

You typically associate an `Integration` instance with an `Application` instance when you create it:

```python
from universal_mcp.applications import APIApplication
from universal_mcp.integrations import ApiKeyIntegration
from universal_mcp.stores import EnvironmentStore

# Example: MyServiceApp uses an API key stored in an environment variable
my_store = EnvironmentStore()
api_key_integration = ApiKeyIntegration(name="MY_SERVICE_API_KEY", store=my_store)
my_app = APIApplication(name="myservice", integration=api_key_integration)
```

In the `ServerConfig` (e.g., in your `local_config.json`), you can also define integrations for specific applications.
