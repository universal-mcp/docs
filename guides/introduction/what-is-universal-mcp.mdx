title: What is Universal MCP?
---

Welcome to the Universal Model Control Protocol (MCP)!

[Universal MCP](https://github.com/universal-mcp/universal-mcp) is a powerful framework designed to bridge the gap between AI models and the vast world of external systems and APIs. At its core, it provides a standardized way for AI to interact with, control, and leverage the functionalities of diverse external services.

Think of it as a universal adapter and control layer that empowers your AI models to:

*   **Execute external functions:** Call out to APIs, run scripts, or interact with databases.
*   **Process and retrieve data:** Fetch information from various sources in a structured manner.
*   **Interact with real-world systems:** Connect to services like GitHub, Gmail, Twitter, and many more.

By providing a consistent and robust mechanism for these interactions, Universal MCP simplifies the development of sophisticated AI agents that can perform complex tasks and workflows that go beyond the boundaries of the AI model itself.

The system is built around a core set of components: **Applications** and **Actions**, supported by an **Integration** system and **Triggers**. These components work together to provide a seamless experience for both developers creating new connections and AI models utilizing them.

Whether you're looking to enable an AI to manage your GitHub issues, summarize Reddit posts, or automate email responses, Universal MCP provides the foundational tools to make it happen.
