title: Configuring Your Server
---

Once Universal MCP is installed, the next step is to configure your server. This is primarily done through a configuration file (commonly `local_config.json` or a custom-named JSON file) or by setting environment variables that map to the `ServerConfig` model.

## Understanding `ServerConfig`

The `ServerConfig` Pydantic model (found in [`config.py`](https://github.com/universal-mcp/universal-mcp/blob/master/src/universal_mcp/config.py)) is the backbone of your server's setup. It defines crucial aspects of how your server behaves. Here are some of ahe key parameters:

*   **`name`**: A descriptive name for your MCP server (e.g., "My Development MCP").
*   **`description`**: A brief description of your server.
*   **`type`**: Specifies the server deployment type. Common values:
    *   `"local"`: A server that loads applications based on the local configuration file. Ideal for development and self-hosting.
    *   `"agentr"`: A server that connects to the AgentR platform to fetch app configurations and manage integrations.
*   **`transport`**: The communication protocol the server will use. Common values:
    *   `"stdio"`: Standard input/output, often used for local CLI tools.
    *   `"sse"`: Server-Sent Events, suitable for web-based clients (like the Playground).
    *   `"http"`: A standard HTTP server.
*   **`port`**: The network port on which the server will listen (e.g., `8005`). This is applicable for `sse` and `http` transports.
*   **`apps`**: (Primarily for `LocalServer`) A list of `AppConfig` objects, defining which applications the server should load and how they are configured.
    *   Each `AppConfig` specifies the `name` of the application (slug) and can include an `integration` block.
*   **`store`**: (Optional) A `StoreConfig` object defining the default credential storage mechanism (e.g., `memory`, `environment`, `keyring`).
*   **`api_key`**: (Primarily for `AgentRServer`) Your AgentR API key if you're using the `agentr` server type.
*   **`debug`**: Boolean to enable debug mode (`True` or `False`).
*   **`log_level`**: Logging level (e.g., "INFO", "DEBUG").

## Creating a Server Configuration File

For a `LocalServer`, you typically create a JSON file (e.g., `local_config.json`) that defines your server's settings.

**Example `local_config.json` for a `LocalServer`:**

```json
{
  "name": "MyFirstMCP Server",
  "description": "A local MCP server for learning and development.",
  "type": "local",
  "transport": "sse",
  "port": 8005,
  "store": {
    "name": "my_mcp_store",
    "type": "memory"
  },
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "zenquotes"
    },
    {
      "name": "tavily",
      "integration": {
        "name": "TAVILY_API_KEY", // This will be the key used in the store
        "type": "api_key",
        "store": {
          "type": "environment" // Tells the integration to look for TAVILY_API_KEY env var
        }
      }
    }
    // Add more applications you want to expose
  ]
}
```

In this example:
*   We're setting up a `LocalServer` named "MyFirstMCP Server".
*   It will use Server-Sent Events (`sse`) on port `8005`.
*   It uses an in-`memory` store for credentials (credentials will be lost when the server stops).
*   It's configured to load two applications:
    *   `zenquotes`: This app might not require explicit integration if it's a public API or configured within its package.
    *   `tavily`: This app uses an `api_key` integration. The `integration` block specifies that the API key named `TAVILY_API_KEY` should be sourced from an `environment` variable store (meaning it will look for an environment variable named `TAVILY_API_KEY`).

## Server Types and Configuration

*   **`LocalServer`**:
    *   Relies heavily on the `apps` array within your configuration file to know which applications (and their tools) to load.
    *   You define integrations (like API keys) directly within the `AppConfig` for each app.
*   **`AgentRServer`**:
    *   Typically fetches its application configurations from the AgentR platform using your `AGENTR_API_KEY`.
    *   Integrations are often managed through the AgentR platform itself.

For these guides, we will primarily focus on the `LocalServer` as it's excellent for development and understanding the core mechanics. Refer to [`servers/server.py`](https://github.com/universal-mcp/universal-mcp/blob/master/src/universal_mcp/servers/server.py) for more information.

With your configuration file ready, you're set to launch the server!
