> **Applications** are the foundation for integrating with external services and platforms (like GitHub, Google, Slack, etc.) in the Universal MCP system. They expose a set of **Actions** and **Triggers** for AI agents to use, enabling seamless automation and real-world interaction.

# What is an Application?

An **Application** represents an integration with an external service or platform. Applications provide a structured way to:

- Manage authentication and credentials
- Handle API communication
- Define available actions (tools)
- Process responses and errors

Applications are the building blocks for connecting your AI agents to the outside world.

---

## Base Classes for Applications

The system provides three main base classes for building applications:

- `BaseApplication`: The abstract base class that defines the common interface
- `APIApplication`: For applications that communicate via HTTP APIs
- `GraphQLApplication`: For applications that use GraphQL APIs

## Implementation Example: Building an API Application

Here's an example of building a simple API Application that fetches a random quote:

```python
from universal_mcp.applications import APIApplication

class ZenquotesApp(APIApplication):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(name="zenquotes", **kwargs)

    def get_quote(self) -> str:
        """
        Fetches a random inspirational quote from the Zen Quotes API.

        Returns:
            A formatted string containing the quote and its author in the format 'quote - author'
        """
        url = "https://zenquotes.io/api/random"
        response = self._get(url)
        data = response.json()
        quote_data = data[0]
        return f"{quote_data['q']} - {quote_data['a']}"

    def list_tools(self):
        return [self.get_quote]
```

## How to Create a New Application

To create a new application, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new package** following the naming convention: `universal_mcp_<app_name>`
2. **Implement your application class** inheriting from one of the base classes
3. **Name your class** following the convention: `<AppName>App`
4. **Define your actions** as methods and register them in `list_tools()`

**Example skeleton:**

```python
from universal_mcp.applications import APIApplication

class MyApp(APIApplication):
    def __init__(self, name: str, integration=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name, integration, **kwargs)
        self.base_url = "https://api.example.com"

    def list_tools(self):
        return [self.my_action]

    def my_action(self):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names for your application and actions.
- Keep authentication and credential management secure and up-to-date.
- Document each action and its expected input/output.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Regularly review and update your application to support new features and maintain compatibility.
