# Actions and Triggers

This page will cover the core concepts of Actions and Triggers in the platform. 

## Actions

Actions enable models to dynamically call external functions or APIs, making them more useful for practical, real-world tasks. By augmenting their capabilities with up-to-date information, automation, and integration with other systems, Actions allow AI agents to interact with the world beyond static data.

### Why Use Actions?
- **Access real-time data:** Fetch the latest information from external sources (e.g., weather, stock prices).
- **Automate workflows:** Perform tasks like sending emails, updating databases, or triggering cloud functions.
- **Integrate with other systems:** Connect your AI with tools like Slack, GitHub, or custom APIs.

### Example: Simple Calculator Action
Below is an example of a simple calculator action that allows an LLM to perform mathematical calculations:

```python
def evaluate(self, expression: str) -> int:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression and return the result as an integer.

    Args:
        expression (str): A string containing a valid mathematical expression.
                          Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, **).
                          Example: "2 + 2", "3 * 4", "10 / 2"

    Returns:
        int: The result of evaluating the expression.
    """
    return eval(expression)
```

This action can be called by the model to compute results on demand, enabling dynamic and context-aware responses.

## Triggers

Triggers act as a notification system for your AI applications, enabling your agents to respond dynamically to external events occurring within your integrations.

### How Triggers Work
- **Event monitoring:** Triggers watch for specific events in applications like GitHub (e.g., new pull request), Gmail (e.g., new email), or any other integrated service.
- **Agent notification:** When the event occurs, the trigger notifies your agent, which can then take appropriate action (e.g., respond, process, escalate).

### Example Use Cases
- **GitHub:** Notify an agent when a new issue is created, so it can triage or label the issue automatically.
- **Gmail:** Alert an agent when an important email arrives, prompting it to draft a reply or update a CRM.
- **Custom integrations:** React to webhook events from any service, enabling endless automation possibilities.

By combining Actions and Triggers, you can build powerful, responsive AI systems that both act on demand and react to the world around them.
