# What is a Connection?

A **connection** is a secure, user-specific link between your application and an external service, established through a particular integration. When a user authorizes your app to access their data on a third-party service, AgentR creates a connection for that user and securely stores the required credentials (such as OAuth tokens or API keys). Each connection is uniquely identified by a `connectionId`.

## Key Features

- Associates authentication credentials with a specific Application and Integration in your Workspace
- Stores security credentials (OAuth tokens, API keys, etc.) securely
- Enables your agents to perform actions on behalf of specific end-users
- Can be enabled, disabled, or deleted as needed

## Owner

An **Owner** represents a connection to an external service (App) for a specific end-user.

> **Tip:** Use connections to manage user-specific access and actions securely across your integrations.
