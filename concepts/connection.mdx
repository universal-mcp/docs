title: "Connection"
---

A connection represents a live, user-specific link between your application and an external service, established using a particular integration. When a user authorizes your app to access their data on a third-party service, AgentR creates a connection for that user, storing the necessary credentials (like OAuth tokens or API keys) securely. Each connection is uniquely identified by a `connectionId`.

# Owner

An Owner represents a connection to an external service (App) for a specific end-user.

- Associates authentication credentials with a specific Application and Integration in your Workspace
