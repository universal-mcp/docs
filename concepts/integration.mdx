An **integration** defines how an application authenticates and communicates with external services and APIs. The Universal MCP system provides a robust framework for managing different types of integrations, each handling specific authentication methods and credential management.

An integration refers to a configuration that defines how your app communicates with a specific external service or API (such as Salesforce, Zendesk, GitHub, etc.). AgentR provides hundreds of pre-built integrations for popular APIs. Each integration handles the API-specific logic and authentication requirements for that service.

## Integration Types

The system supports three main types of integrations:

### API Key Integration

- Simple authentication using API keys
- Keys can be stored in environment variables, system keyring, or memory

**Example configuration:**

```json
{
  "name": "tavily",
  "integration": {
    "name": "TAVILY_API_KEY",
    "type": "api_key",
    "store": {
      "type": "environment"  // Or "keyring", "memory"
    }
  }
}
```

### OAuth Integration

- Direct OAuth implementation for services not integrated with AgentR
- Requires manual configuration of client IDs, secrets, and callback handling
- More complex to set up but provides direct control over the OAuth flow

Currently authentication methods supported are:

// (You may want to list supported OAuth methods here if available)

### AgentR Integration

- Handles OAuth flows and credential management through the AgentR platform
- Requires `AGENTR_API_KEY` environment variable

**Example configuration:**

```json
{
  "name": "github",
  "integration": {
    "name": "github",  // Matches service name in AgentR
    "type": "agentr"
  }
}
```
