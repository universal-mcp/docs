# What is an Integration?

An **integration** defines how your application authenticates and communicates with external services and APIs. The Universal MCP system provides a robust framework for managing different types of integrations, each handling specific authentication methods and credential management.

Integrations allow your app to connect with popular APIs (such as Salesforce, Zendesk, GitHub, etc.) using pre-built or custom configurations. Each integration manages the API-specific logic and authentication requirements for that service.

## Integration Types

The system supports three main types of integrations:

### API Key Integration

- Simple authentication using API keys
- Keys can be stored in environment variables, system keyring, or memory

**Example configuration:**

```json
{
  "name": "tavily",
  "integration": {
    "name": "TAVILY_API_KEY",
    "type": "api_key",
    "store": {
      "type": "environment"  // Or "keyring", "memory"
    }
  }
}
```

### OAuth Integration

- Direct OAuth implementation for services not integrated with AgentR
- Requires manual configuration of client IDs, secrets, and callback handling
- Provides direct control over the OAuth flow

> **Note:** List supported OAuth methods here if available.

### AgentR Integration

- Handles OAuth flows and credential management through the AgentR platform
- Requires `AGENTR_API_KEY` environment variable

**Example configuration:**

```json
{
  "name": "github",
  "integration": {
    "name": "github",  // Matches service name in AgentR
    "type": "agentr"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Choose the integration type that matches your security and user experience needs.
- Store credentials securely using environment variables or keyrings.
- Regularly review and update integration configurations to maintain security.
- Refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference) for details on supported integrations and configuration options.
